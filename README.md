## Description

This website was created to provide a user the ability to enter events into a work day scheduler. As a reference point the current day of the week, month and date are displayed under the jumbotron. Within the body of the page the current hour is displayed red, past hours are gray and future hours are green. After the user inputs an event at a specific hour they are then able to select the save button. Upon selecting the save button the user's input is saved to local storage and persists on the website even after it is refreshed.
